                1. First, make a nest with the flour on a clean work surface.<br>
                2. Next, use your hands to gently mix in the flour.<br>
                3. Then, knead!<br>
                4. When the dough comes together, shape it into a ball and wrap it in plastic wrap<br>
                5. After the dough rests, slice it into 4 pieces.<br>
                6. Use a rolling pin or your hands to gently flatten one into an oval disk.<br>
                7. Then, run it through the widest setting of your pasta maker. <br>
                8. Next, fold the dough… if you want to.<br>
                9. Then, fold it in half lengthwise to form a rectangle.<br>
                10 .Once you’ve folded the dough, roll it out to your desired thickness.<br>
                11. Repeat these steps with the remaining dough pieces.<br>
                12. Finally, cut and cook the pasta!
